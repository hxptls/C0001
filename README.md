****************

To explain what I did in `C0001`, I think the comments in the code is enough:

>The basic logic here is to try every simple string of original name into the shorten system and find which is both short enough and unused.

>Now I finish it. And a thought came to me: why not try to visit a shortened url and find out both what its original name is and whether it has been used? I think I'm stupid. It must be caused of that the time is too late(3:31).

>Fix it when I open this code next time. \*_\*
